# Roll for Sandwich #
"""User will roll different sided dice for each element of a sandwich, resulting in a potentially very random lunch!"""

# Import setup.py to play the game
import setup

# Greeting
print("ðŸŽ² ðŸ¥ª Welcome to Roll for Sandwich, where we let fate decide our lunch! ðŸ¥ª ðŸŽ²")
print()

# Play the game
setup.roll_for_sandwich()












# --------------
# Nice to haves:
	# Put all the roll_for_____ functions into one function and then use parameters to differentiate (would require putting print statements outside the functions)
	# Different print statements for different ratings
	# Options in the data sets for None
	# Options in the data sets for Roll Again
		# Butter the bread and roll again, etc
	# Options in the data sets for Roll Again With Two Dice (for double options)
	# Options in the data sets for Dealer's Choice of items (user can select any option from the existing list)
	# Maybe add startswith so the user can also type 'yeah' or 'nope', etc.


# --------------------
# Extra nice-to-haves:
	# Option for user to enter their own data sets
	# Dealer's choice ultimate (user can select any option from the existing list OR type in their own item)
